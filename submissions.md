## <a name="poetry">Poetry:</a>

 
Please submit outwardly directed poetry that exhibits social, political, geographical, historical or spiritual awareness. We are open to traditional and experimental forms. Above all, we are interested in great poetry that moves us.  

Simultaneous submissions are welcome, but please notify us if they are accepted elsewhere.  

We do not accept previously published work.  

Poetry submissions should be typed, single-spaced, and include page numbers. Italicize or underline words to be italicized. Note that bold-faced type cannot be reproduced. With rare exceptions, we do not double-space poems.  

Include a cover letter with your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and brief (one-paragraph) bio.  

Submit a maximum of five poems for consideration per issue.  

Payment is one copy.

## <a name="essays_reviews">Essays & Book Reviews:</a>

All essays and reviews must be germane to poetry and are accepted under the provision that the author be willing to work with the editors on recommended changes (length, punctuation, general editing, etc.). Essays and reviews must be submitted ahead of the deadline for each issue.  

Editors are particularly interested in essays that draw attention to the work of overlooked poets.  

Editors are partial to book reviews that consider more than one work.  

Review and essay submissions should be typed, double-spaced, and include page numbers. Name, address, phone number, and e-mail address should appear on the first page.  

Reviewers must include a cover letter with a brief bio.
Reviews should be no longer than 1500 words, though longer reviews are acceptable when several books are under consideration. Include date of publication, price, and publisher for all works considered.  

Essays should be 2500 words or less.  

Deadline: Editors have two reading cycles. Check submission periods below for our next cycle:  

* Fall/Winter issue: March 30 – June 30  

* Spring/Summer issue: September 15 – December 15  

Do not submit work while we are considering a previous submission.  

Note: We may wish to include the names/works of published authors on our web site and/or in conjunction with advertisements for the journal.

## <a name="art">Art:</a>

Each issue of Borderlands includes up to 10 black-and-white reproductions and one color reproduction on the cover by local, state, and nationally emerging or established artists. Subject matter is open although the images should represent a cohesive body of work as opposed to individual, disconnected pieces.  

Submit on CD your digital images or send us a link to your site for us to review your work. Once your work is selected for publication, you will need to submit: artist statement, bio, art titles, artist contact info, as well as high resolution digital images (TIFF) of works selected.  

Deadline: Submissions received at the address below by June 15 will be considered for the Winter issue, and submissions received by December 15 will be considered for the Summer issue. We cannot make exceptions for postal discrepancies.  

Accepted work will be returned after the publication of the journal.  

Terms of Acceptance: At this time, there is no remuneration for the published artwork. However, each artist will receive two complimentary copies of the journal and will be invited to participate in gallery exhibits arranged by the journal.
