*Borderlands: Texas Poetry Review* is a literary journal based in Austin, Texas that publishes poetry along with photographs, reviews and essays.

Our four-color cover features the work of area artists. The journal's mission is to publish work of merit that shows an awareness of connection -- historical, social, political and spiritual. 

Borderlands is a national publication with a special interest in supporting Texas and other southwestern poets and artists through publication and public readings. The journal is funded in part by the City of Austin Cultural Funding Program and the Texas Commission on the Arts.
