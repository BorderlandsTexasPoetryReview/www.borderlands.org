We've come a long way since the first "unofficial" board meeting in 1991. When we started out wanting beautiful poems that lifted the human spirit, we had no idea that running a journal was a full-time occupation.

We are an all volunteer staff dedicated to the advancement of poetry and art. Borderlands has received the highest praise from national and local reviewers.

*Borderlands* is funded in part by the City of Austin Cultural Funding Program. Founders include Dorothy Barnett, D'Arcy Randall, Liz Garton Scanlon, Hazel Ward, Lynn Gilbert, Pamela Cook and Alice Batt.

Board: Deborah A. Akers, Ramona Cearley, Joe Herrera, Amy Schrader

Advisory Board: Dorothy Barnett, Liz Garton Scanlon, D'Arcy Randall
