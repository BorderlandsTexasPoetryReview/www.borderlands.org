We've come a long way since the first unofficial board meeting in 1991. When we started out wanting beautiful poems that lifted the human spirit, we had no idea that running a journal was a full-time occupation.

We are an all volunteer staff dedicated to the advancement of poetry and art. *Borderlands* has received the highest praise from national and local reviewers.

*Borderlands* is funded in part by the City of Austin Cultural Funding Program. Founders include Dorothy Barnett, D'Arcy Randall, Liz Garton Scanlon, Hazel Ward, Lynn Gilbert, Pamela Cook and Alice Batt.  

Appointed art director in 1996, Ramona Cearley served as the journal's first administrative director for 18 years, retiring from her position in 2018.  

Board: Deborah A. Akers (Emerita), Dr. Ignacio Carvajal, Cindy Huyser, Maggie Ilersich, Dr. Patrick Walter

Advisory Board: Dorothy Barnett, D'Arcy Randall
