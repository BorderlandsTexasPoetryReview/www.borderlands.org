<p>Reviewers must include a cover letter with a brief bio.
Reviews should be no longer than 1500 words, though longer reviews are acceptable when several books are under consideration. Include date of publication, price, and publisher for all works considered.</p>

<p>Essays should be 2500 words or less.</p>
